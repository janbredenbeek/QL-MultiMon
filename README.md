# QL-MultiMon
A Machine code monitor and disassembler for the Sinclair QL, originally written in 1986-87. Many enhancements were added in v3.1. This is a release which I believe is fairly stable. 
The executable file is in MULTIMON.ZIP, which should be unpacked using QL Unzip v5.41 (see https://dilwyn.qlforum.co.uk/arch/index.html on how to obtain it). This ZIP file also contains the manual in MultiMon.md.
